Android applications start out typically in a monolith design. One module for all project logic with ease of access for quick iteration. If your project is very successful, you might eventually run into a few issues. The most obvious one would be that your build times will start to creep up. With all of your code in one module, the build cache will rebuild the whole project upon any change. The more subtle issue is around maintainability. As you have no strict boundaries, it is easy for concessions to be made and things slowly start getting tightly coupled together.

I'm sure given enough time we could come up with a host of other problems or try to explain away how in your particular case this isn't a problem, but here me out for a moment. Speaking from my own experience those problems do happen and when they do it can be difficult to even know where to start. Do I just start splitting the monolith up into modules? How do I do that in a way that isn't just kicking the can down the road? Has this problem been solved before?
## Abstraction and Encapsulation
#### Web services
One of the most common things we interact with outside of our projects are web services. Typically we connect and leverage them through common protocols like JSON or Protobuf, with strong API contracts defined per service. This tells us exactly how we should interact with them, and what is and what is not allowed. Using this as an example, we can look at our usage of them kind of like this:
<p align="center" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/modules/api.png" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Interfaces
A common pattern is the usage of a style of class called an interface. It allows us to easily define what exact behavior of a class is, without referencing the class itself. This can be useful for cases where we want to abstract out the implementation from the consumer of the class, or if we want to be able to switch out the implementation itself without impacting the consumer. Lots of good reasons to use an interface exist, but we can also simplify it down to something like this:
<p align="center" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/modules/interfaces.png" width="100%" />
</p>

## Modules
#### Standing on the shoulders of giants
The examples shown above highlight a commonality seen across domains. Using an abstraction, we are able to scope behavior and easily maintain our business logic. This can be adapted to our own problem. If we break up our code such that we define a single unit into both a contract and an implementation, it can be accessed without needing to pulling in the whole implementation.
<p align="center" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/modules/simple.png" width="100%" />
</p>

#### Build cache
The ramifications to breaking up your code like this, is that only your contracts are references by consuming code. This allows the build cache to only need to rebuild what has been changed. For example if you adjusted an implementation of a given unit, the callers wouldn't need to be rebuilt. They only accessed it via the interface so nothing changed for them.
#### Maintainability
Since we are now enforcing the access of business logic via contract it makes it much harder to intermingle across boundaries, since they are strictly defined. You can always change or extend them as needed but it is a very intention change. If your team is big enough those contracts could even have different code owners who might have an opinion on changing the contract.
#### Scaled out
You won't be able to avoid the spiderweb that will become your module dependency graph, but using this technique your modules will remain lightweight. You will need to ensure all dependencies on the contract modules are contracts or external dependencies, or you won't benefit from the build cache benefits. If you have existing modules already you should attempt to create a contract for them and dereference them, or refactor the module altogether.
<p align="center" style="padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:20px;">

</p>

#### Implementation details
Contract modules can comprise of interfaces, data classes, enum/sealed classes, and constants. Implementations can be bound to the implementations via dependency injection, preferably using Hilt. You can even abstract away entire experiences behind a contract and simply launch them via interface. Edge cases like reusable views should probably be standalone modules only used by implementations, but keep it tightly scoped or it quickly can get out of hand.
