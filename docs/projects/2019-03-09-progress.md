## Overview
Progress is a simple fitness tracker for managing your weight, calories, and water intake. This project is made of both an Android client written in Kotlin along with a server component written in Java. This project is publicly available through the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handlerexploit.fitness) and is still in active development.

## Android Project Design
The architecture of this project was designed off of the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and [MVP patterns](http://konmik.com/post/introduction_to_model_view_presenter_on_android/). From a high level it is designed to allow decoupling of responsibility for ease of maintainability and testing purposes. An earlier pre-Kotlin version of such design can be found broken down in detail [here](https://medium.com/@scottmeschke/android-decompile-deepdive-ted-cf97267229e).

Code structure alone will not allow you to see the benefits of this pattern. Specific hard and fast rules are in place at a design guideline level to keep everything properly decoupled.

- *All entities will be immutable.*
- *All interactors will be the most ideal interface for requesting the associated entity.*
- *All presenters will know nothing of Android.*
- *All view interactions (clicks/visibility changes/ect.) will be triggered from a presenter.*

## Server Project Design
This server component was my first example of using the [Spring framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/overview.html) in a production environment. Since the userbase of this project is still in the single digits scaling wasn't much of a concern so using a simple SQLite JDBC integration for the backend data made perfect sense. Authentication via any number of social or even anonymous sources is handled by Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) platform.

This setup is all configured in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and ran off a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/). Network requests are filtered through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to protect us from any denial of service attacks. Since our data is not being handled in any distributed manor we have automatic backups configured to export directly to [Amazon S3 Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/).

Since initial deployment we have had three outages but they were only caused by the underlying hardware on Digital Ocean requiring a reboot and caused no issues. Our average median response time over the last six months is 160ms.
