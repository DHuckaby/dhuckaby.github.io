Digging a bit further we need to understand how we can safely switch between those aliases without impacting our users negatively.</p> <p>The way we reference an activity-alias in code is via a class called <code>ComponentName</code>, for example the equivalent of the enabled alias above is <code>ComponentName(pkg, \"$pkg.AliasDefault\")</code>. This is used when communicating with the <code>PackageManager</code> class, specifically we want to use it when calling <code>getComponentEnabledSetting</code> and <code>setComponentEnabledSetting</code>.</p> <p>At a high level we need to be able to not only enable the currently disabled alias, but also disable the currently enabled alias. If we blindly switch the states it will work, but your application will close automatically every single time you do. If you only want it to happen the first time you need to take into account the original default state. So when enabling the default alias, you just need to set the state to default.

The last few years Google has been pushing their new layout system Jetpack Compose pretty hard. Those who use it cast aside the old ways like they are inferior and I am susceptible to a little bit of fear of missing out from time to time. So I decided to dip my toes into it by diving headfirst into the deep end with no flotation device. With everyone I knew that knows Compose on holiday, I loaded up Android Studio and created a new project.</p> <p>The first step I decided to do was document my existing Busted API using an OpenAPI 3.0 config and generate a client integration via SwaggerHub. This provided an honestly bad implementation to interface with but so far it has been functional enough that I have not bothered to write my own yet. With a couple wrapper classes I could hide away their bad auto-generated code. After configuring authentication I was effectively ready to start building out my user interface.</p> <p>Building with Compose overall is frustrating</p> <p>All of the institutional knowledge that we have obtained for building user interfaces can largely be thrown out. Components are named just different enough that they are unintuitive, and some things are named the same but can act differently depending on the context or even order of operations. For example, margin and padding back in the xml layout system had clear and defined behaviors. Both of those concepts are now combined into simply padding and depending on if you add a background before or after you set the padding it will display differently.</p> <p>I based my Compose integration upon the JetNews sample provided by Google and leveraged M3 components. At this point in time this is the absolute bleeding edge of what they recommend. Building out all of the top level sections I was able to fully immerse myself into the new layout system. I have a single Activity + ViewModel design with multiple sections all backed by a single state representing my view layer. Coordinating side effects like dialogs and snackbars can be a bit convoluted but that is what you get when you have a single state generating everything.</p> <p>This exercise was a good one, but I don't think this is the final iteration of the layout system. As the system matures over time we will be able to build amazing things with it. I will not be casting the xml layout system aside for now, but for non-production code I will also be using Compose.

This abstraction allows the user to choose what to download and where from.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#option-1-supporting-the-existing-implementation","title":"Option 1: Supporting the existing implementation","text":"<p>In the past I had built my own extension for a web comic I was reading, so I am accustomed to the overall structure of an extension. Looking at the code for a couple sites I normally download from though showcased a wide array of different kinds of implementations. It would be difficult to long term support this by myself, even if I dropped the sites I don't need. This would also inherit a pain point encountered from time to time: extensions breaking due to website or Cloudflare changes. When this happens you are unable to read any content not downloaded. This encourages users to download a bunch of content at once, increasing the load on the sites.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#option-2-writing-my-own","title":"Option 2: Writing my own","text":"<p>Taking a step back from the existing implementation I looked at the problem as a whole. Scraping websites and extracting content is a solved problem. At the scale that Tachiyomi was doing it effectively it was crushing the sites like a distributed attack constantly. It doesn't need to be this way for my own project because I don't plan on distributing it at all. We could in theory just have a web service occasionally poll the sites and only download what we need. The service becomes the source of truth and even if my scraping code breaks, I have access to the backlog of content. Even if the latest is unavailable until I fix the broken scraper. The initial sync will be intensive, but compared to Tachiyomi it will be nothing.</p> <p>This sounded promising so I investigated how I could integrate this theoretical web scraping service into an extension. Although I could write this myself, along with extracting data from the soon-to-be downloaded files: this is also a solved problem. I came across a project called Komga, it not only can serve locally hosted content but also happens to already have a Tachiyomi extension. This in theory could solve the other half of the problem for me. The only major risk in relying upon this project is if they drop support for their extension long term, but that is a problem for future me who loves taking on those kinds of surprise challenges.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#mangari","title":"Mangari","text":"<p>Ultimately I decided upon Option 2, the service soon to be named Mangari. Realistically it wasn't that simple though. I did review a few existing tools that could do different parts of the job, but the closest I could find was one called mangal. This tool could do all the web scraping, but was all configured in Lua. I was not comfortable jumping into that codebase with minimal experience in web scraping and Lua, which I have not touched since the PSP was king.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#web-scraping","title":"Web scraping","text":"<p>Previously with projects like Progress and Busted I have leveraged the Spring framework in Java or Kotlin for spinning up web services.

This would also allow me to utilize my JSoup experience from Tweedle, but realistically I have not touched that in years. In the end I threw out all of that sane decision making and wrote it in Python with BeautifulSoup as the core.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#cloudflare","title":"Cloudflare","text":"<p>One of the biggest challenges in web scraping is trying to bypass Cloudflare protections. They are typically in place to deter bots and denial of service attacks. This adds an extra layer of security to any website (for a price) to ensure malicious actors are not misusing your website.</p> <p>FlareSolverr acts as a proxy that can attempt to bypass all of those protections. It is updated semi-regularly and has a large community of users using it to enable their web scrapers. This is used to scrap all sorts of websites and is supported by many tools as a built in option if you self host it. It isn't perfect, but it is better than just switching your headers and hoping for the best like with Tachiyomi.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#komga","title":"Komga","text":"<p>The last piece of the puzzle was understanding how the data should be formatted on disk. After reviewing all of the documentation I could find and testing out a few options I ended up on the following format:</p> <pre><code>Library/Series/cover.jpg\nLibrary/Series/mangari.json\nLibrary/Series/series.json\nLibrary/Series/Chapter 1.cbz\n                    /0.jpg\n                    /...\n                    /190.jpg\n                    /ComicInfo.xml\nLibrary/Series/...\nLibrary/Series/Chapter 203.cbz\n</code></pre> <p>The library and series paths are pretty self explanatory. Stepping into the series folder we want to be able to display a cover image for the whole series, along with metadata and the chapters themselves. The structure of mangari.json is custom and provides the information I need about the source site, how often we should refresh, and when we last refreshed. The series.json file is a standard metadata format from mylar.</p> <p>Looking at the cbz file, it is a standard comic book zip archive format. The variant used here includes the images along with a ComicInfo.xml file per chapter. A now defunct comic book downloader named ComicRack pioneered this format and was so popular that it now lives on beyond the downloader with community driven support.</p> <p>With all of this figured out I formatted the files carefully within the correct directories, and would leverage Komga's api to refresh the metadata on their side. This updates the index and within no time I am able to see the latest content within Tachiyomi.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2024-09-17-manga/#android","title":"Android","text":"<p>With all of the pieces coming together, I wanted to be able to be able to check the status of things without directly checking the docker output logs. Taking my time I went through options like Flutter and .NET but ultimately came back to my roots and wrote it in Android via Compose.

Flaresolverr ended up not being as stable as I wanted. Some websites had some pretty tough anti-bot code to work through.

Wouldn't it be nice if I could just manually click the box and bypass captcha if it was broken like a mechanical turk?</p> <p>In theory if I could refactor the implementation so that I no longer directly rely upon things like Flaresolverr, I could swap it out with other options. It could be one of the many forks of Flaresolverr, or something wild like an Android application that directly loads the content into a WebView and pipes the content back like a proxy.

Getting the existing api contract up and running using Ktor was really simple, even though it was my first time using the framework. I have used JSoup before, but not with the level of detail needed for this project. In the end, css queries were the MVP and serve as the backbone of the project.</p> <p>I ended up writing three different Daemon (request handler) implementations. The first one was for Flaresolverr, the second was for MITM proxy, and lastly an Android client for proxying manually if things ever broke. I have some other options as well that I might try, a browser plugin could be nice for example.
